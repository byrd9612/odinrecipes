    <h1>Easy Homemade Lasagna</h1>
    <h4> Homemade Lasagna is a classic recipe that every 
        cook should have in their rotation.</h4>
        Tender sheets of pasta, a creamy ricotta cheese 
        filling, and a rich meaty tomato sauce are all topped with 
        more cheese  and baked until browned and bubbly.
        While there are a few steps to this lasagna recipe, 
        it’s easy to make and has so much flavor. 
        This dish can be made ahead of time and freezes well 
        either before or after baking!

     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <p> For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and 
         parmesan with seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. 
         No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</p>
     
             <p><strong>Cheese Filling:</strong>  For this classic lasagna recipe, 
             the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings and a couple of 
             tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese 
             works just fine in this recipe!</p>
       
             <p><strong>Meat:</strong> I use both Italian sausage and 
             ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of
             fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.</p>
       
             <p></p><strong>Sauce:</strong> To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce
             or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned
             tomatoes if you’d prefer)
          
            <p></p><strong>Spinach (variation):</strong> To make a spinach lasagna, 
             squeeze out most of the moisture of defrosted frozen spinach and add it along with the cheese layer.</p>
        
            <p><i>Lasagna ingredients don’t have to be limited to the ones you see here. 
              Substitute meats or different cheeses, or try different meat sauce variations.</i></p>
